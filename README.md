## Problem Title
SIH 1653: Web based Selector-Applicant Simulation Software
## Problem Description
Background: Recruitment and Assessment Centre (RAC) under DRDO, Ministry of Defence carries out interviews for applications received against advertised vacancies and for promotion to next higher grade for scientific manpower inducted within DRDO. Description: The process of interviewing is a challenging task. An unbiased objective interviewing process helps identify the right talent. The basic process of an interview involves posing a set of questions by an interviewer and thereafter evaluating responses from candidates. Thus, the questions asked should be relevant and match the area/ expertise of the applicant and the responses should also be of relevance w.r.t. the question asked. Expected Solution: The proposed solution should provide experts as well as candidates a real life Board Room experience, starting with initial ice-breaking questions leading to in-depth techno-managerial (depending on the level of candidate) questions. It shall also be able to provide a quantifiable score for experts as well as the candidate for the relevancy of questions w.r.t. the area/ expertise of the applicant. Similarly, candidate responses should also be graded for relevancy w.r.t. the question asked, finally assisting in arriving at an overall score for the subject knowledge of the candidate and thus his/ her suitability against the advertised post.

## Idea
1. Core Features & Functionalities
A. Simulation of a Real-Life Board Room Interview
Virtual Interview Environment: A web-based interface where candidates and interviewers interact.
Role-Based Access:
Candidates (answer questions)
Interviewers (ask questions, assess responses)
Admin/Observers (monitor and evaluate the process)
Ice-Breaking Questions: The system initiates introductory questions before moving to techno-managerial questions.
B. Intelligent Question Selection & Relevance Matching
Dynamic Question Bank:
Pre-loaded domain-specific questions.
AI-generated questions based on candidate profile and job role.
AI-Based Relevance Matching:
Questions should match the candidate‚Äôs expertise (based on resume, skills).
Irrelevant questions flagged for interviewer improvement.
C. Candidate Response Evaluation
AI-Based Scoring Mechanism:
Evaluates relevance, completeness, and clarity of responses.
Uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) for response analysis.
Provides quantitative score for each response.
Peer & Expert Review:
Experts can manually rate responses.
AI-generated suggestions for unbiased scoring.
D. Interviewer Performance Evaluation
Question Quality Score: AI assigns a score based on:
Relevance to candidate‚Äôs expertise.
Depth (basic, intermediate, advanced).
Variability (not repeating similar questions).
Feedback for Interviewers: Identifies biases, helps in refining question selection.
E. Final Candidate Assessment & Report Generation
Overall Score Calculation:
Subject Knowledge Score
Communication Score
Managerial Capability Score
Candidate Suitability Report:
Strengths & Weaknesses
Recommendations for hiring/promotion
